# cvat-ui module

## Description

This is a client UI for Computer Vision Annotation Tool based on React, Redux and Antd

## Versioning

If you make changes in this package, please do following:

- After not important changes (typos, bug fixes, refactoring) do: `yarn version --patch`
- After adding new features do: `yarn version --minor`
- After significant UI redesign do: `yarn version --major`

Important: If you have changed versions for `cvat-core`, `cvat-canvas`, `cvat-data`,
you also need to do `yarn install` to update `package-lock.json`

## Commands

- Installing dependencies:

```bash
cd ../cvat-core && yarn --frozen-lockfile && cd - && yarn --frozen-lockfile
```

- Running development UI server with autorebuild on change

```bash
yarn run start
```

- Building the module from sources in the `dist` directory:

```bash
yarn run build
yarn run build --mode=development     # without a minification
```

Important: You also have to run CVAT REST API server (please read `https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/contributing/`)
to correct working since UI gets all necessary data (tasks, users, annotations) from there

### Running the server

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

Note: If you don't have docker installed, see https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

To see the the UI, navigate to http://localhost:8080/

## Important directories and their purposes:

Although the codebase is relatively large, it is organized in a way that makes it easy to navigate and understand. Here are some of the important directories and their purposes:

- standard-workspace

  `cvat/cvat-ui/src/components/annotation-page/standard-workspace`

This directory contains the code for the standard workspace, which is the main part of the annotation tool. It includes the canvas, the controls, and the sidebar.

- controls-side-bar

  `cvat/cvat-ui/src/components/annotation-page/standard-workspace/controls-side-bar`

This directory contains the code and icons for the sidebar that contains the controls for the annotation tool.

## Adding a new component:
- Create a new file for the component in the appropriate directory. For example, to add a new icon to the sidebar, you would create a new file (new-icon-control.tsx) in the `controls-side-bar` directory.

## Unit tests:

You need to write unit test for the new component you added. As of now, we're using Jest
for unit testing. Read the docs here https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started

- Writing tests:
You can do so by creating a new file in the `tests` directory or create a new `tests` directory if there
is no tests directory. For example to write a test for the new icon control, you would create a new file (new-icon-control.test.tsx) in the `tests` directory.

- Running the tests:
Make sure you are the cvat-ui folder and run the following command to run the tests:

```bash
yarn run test
```
## Test coverage percentage:

Tests coverage is a measure of how much of the code is tested by the unit tests. In this project, we aim to have a test coverage of at least 80%. To learn more about test coverage, you can read this article https://www.valentinog.com/blog/jest-coverage/

To run the tests with coverage:
```bash
yarn run test --coverage
```

## Styling conventions:
- We use styled-components for styling.
- We use the BEM naming convention for styling.

Each directory contains one scss file. To add style to new a component, just give the elements a class name that follows the BEM naming convention. and go the scss file and add the style to the class name.

## Finding a file in the codebase:
As the codebase is large, it can be difficult to find a specific file. Here are some tips for finding a file:

- Step 1: - Use the developer console in your browser to inspect the DOM elements and their class names.
- Step 2: Use the search bar in your IDE (CMD + Shift + F) to search for the file name.
